##  Key Dashboard Insights

High Attrition Rate: The company has an overall 17% attrition rate (492 employees).

Male Dominance: Male attrition (63%) is nearly double that of female attrition (37%).

Age Risk: The 26-35 age group has the highest number of departures.

Key Roles at Risk: Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists are the top three roles losing employees.

Near-by Paradox: Employees who live Near-by (296) have the highest attrition, which is counter-intuitive and needs investigation.

Travel Correlation: Employees who Travel Rarely (325) or Travel Frequently (141) account for the vast majority of attrition.

 ## Top Recommendations
 
Target High-Risk Roles & Demographics: Launch immediate stay interviews for the top four high-attrition roles. Focus on understanding compensation, workload, and career path concerns for male employees aged 26-35.

Investigate Proximity and Travel: Determine why employees living Near-by are leaving (e.g., perceived availability, uncompensated overtime). Review and improve policies for both frequent and rare travelers.

Protect High Performers: Cross-reference the 492 attritions with the 413 High-Performance employees. Implement a robust retention and compensation review for top talent to prevent a significant loss of company value.
